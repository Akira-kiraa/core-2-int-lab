    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Typography & the Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        In this article, the author Loretta Staples gives a detailed account of the evolution of digital technology and typography at the end of the 20th century. The development of hardware technology for printing devices was accompanied by the digital construction of letterforms, which expanded the possibilities. Designers became aware of the aesthetic potential of computer-based graphic design in this process, and emerging technologies were applied not only to traditional paper media, but also to the interactive medium of the computer screen because of the development of web technologies. As we can see through the article, the development of digital technology from the 1980s to the late 1990s was inextricably linked to the development of typographic design.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        This article mentions the development of GUI and the history behind it and the impact it has had. It tells the story of the transformation of computer interfaces from black screens to the white screens of the 1970s, and is an apt metaphor for the theft and elimination of black. It also explores how white men, with their primitive accumulation in the high-tech field, have dominated the establishment of ideology, achieving monopoly and exclusion in the field. In order to combat and eliminate discrimination, the author proposes to promote black gooey to resist the elimination of ideology by white gooey. <br><br>
        Although the article seems to be primarily about race, I'm a little concerned about the part where it mentions but doesn't discuss more. First, the authors mention that black and white screens divide people into programmers and users. Second, the author mentions that the white screen also represents the constant energy consumption of capitalism's wasteful power.
