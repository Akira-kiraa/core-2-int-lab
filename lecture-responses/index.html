    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Elaine Lopez</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
    Elaine discusses the concept of decolonization in the design industry and emphasizes that it should not be treated as a mere metaphor. The design field has historically struggled to embrace diversity, as it remains predominantly white, and Elaine believes there is still much progress to be made. In light of this, she proposes the idea of "colonizing" design. <br><br>
    According to Elaine, culture and identity are deeply personal and unique to each individual. She advocates for everyone to create work that reflects their own cultural background and identity. Design can serve as a powerful tool for learning about and sharing cultures. By blending different cultural influences and ideas, individuals can establish a strong connection with their work and produce something deeply personal. <br><br>
    This lecture offered valuable insights and prompted me to reconsider my own identity and culture. It reminded me that our cultural identity is a source of strength, and it inspired me to reconnect with my own heritage through design.

    <p>
        Lynn's lecture provided valuable insights into the inner workings of independent design studios and the significance of building relationships in shaping a successful career. <br><br>
        Lynn provided invaluable insights into the journey of establishing her design studio, Dome Collective, as a team of two individuals. Listening to Kiang's experiences shed light on the remarkable achievements of her small team in delivering such substantial undertakings. It was remarkable to discover how they managed to accomplish these ambitious projects despite their limited size. Kiang emphasized the critical importance of assembling a team with diverse expertise, including software development, cinematography, fabrication, motion design, and more. This collaboration of skilled individuals played a pivotal role in the team's overall success.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Pascal Glissmann</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Pascal Glissmann's lecture provided captivating insights into unconventional design projects that aim to assist and unite people. One particularly memorable project involved challenging young designers to create a specific set of symbols that captured the essence of the present. This endeavor prompted participants to contemplate diverse perspectives and explore how design can effectively represent various groups. <br><br>
        Another noteworthy point emphasized by Glissmann during the lecture was the importance of collaborating with communities to develop meaningful projects that engage individuals from different backgrounds. By involving people in the design process, Glissmann fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment that encourages the sharing of ideas and perspectives. I believe this approach is essential in design, as it ensures that projects resonate with and reflect the needs and experiences of the intended audience.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Kelly Walters</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Kelly Walters is a designer who explores various mediums such as printmaking, critical writing, and publishing. She delves into the realm of black history and the history of women, experimenting with different approaches in printmaking to express her passion. I believe that reflecting on design history to make informed decisions for the future is essential in design.<br><br>
        One aspect that truly fascinates me about Walters' work is how it consistently incorporates a historical perspective. Her projects delve into the designs of bygone eras and examine the functioning of design during those times. Through her work, Walters delves into semantic changes within the discipline and offers valuable insights into the evolution of design.
