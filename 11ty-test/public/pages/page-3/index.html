<p>Data is all around us and can help us understand new aspects about our environment. Using the New York City open data, you will select a dataset to work with. New York collects data ranging from parking violations to squirrel census. On its own, the data is a set of numbers that are difficult to comprehend without a visualization. Look through your chosen data and consider how you can tell a story through different subsets of it — you do not need to include all of it. Consider the relationship between the form, the story, and the data itself. How does the data’s container help encourage an understanding of the data not possible without it? Feel free to add in mixed media content to help tell this story, and avoid using traditional data visualizations such as bar graphs and pie charts.</p>
